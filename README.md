A website for playing the ancient Mesopotamian board game, The Royal Game of Ur!

</a></p>

This repository holds the server code for RoyalUr.net, https://royalur.net.
The client code of RoyalUr.net can be found in the
[RoyalUrClient repository](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient).

RoyalUr.net was created based upon the ancient Sumerian board game, The Royal Game of Ur,
in the British Museum. The original board game can be dated to 2600 BC, and was discovered
in a royal tomb in the city-state of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia.  Learn more about the game
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur), or watch a fun match
between Tom Scott and Irving Finkel on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/WZskjLq040I)!

The game also has a Discord and a Reddit that you might want to check out! The Discord
can be used to chat about the game, find worthy opponents to challenge, discuss the
development of RoyalUr.net, and it also contains a changelog with a summary of the changes
being made to the website.
